## Installation

Clone the GitHub repo to the user's computer. Run "npm i" in the terminal to install all of the necessary packages. Then, the user can start the server using "npm start". Next, the user can navigate to their localhost:3001, or this link to begin tracking their budget.

## Usage

If the user wishes to post a user to the database, they can use insomnia and change the endpoints to /api/users. If they wish to post a thought, they can post a thought at the /api/thoughts endpoint. They can also display the data in the browser on http://localhost:3001/api/users or which ever endpoint they would like to use. In insomnia, the user can create, update, or delete data from the database by changing the method and endpoint of the url. 

Here is a screenshot of what the user data looks like in insomnia:
